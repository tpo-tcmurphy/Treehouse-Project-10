This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, users are required to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

This utilizes React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

## Instructions
1. Navigate to the **api** folder in your terminal and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run seed` to populate the database with the sample data
3. Run `npm start` to start the database
4. In a separate terminal, navigate to the **client** folder
5. Run `npm install`
6. Then run `npm start` to view on `http://localhost:3000`

## Features
- Persists user credentials
- Redirects after successful sign-in
- Displays messages for errors, such as when a page cannot be found
